# vdbench_graphite.sh is a bash script to feed parsed vdbench output to graphite
#
# Requires netcat (nc), tee, awk, graphite, and vdbench
# http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/vdbench-downloads-1901681.html
#
# To execute, simply run vdbench and pipe to this script.  By default it will send stats to graphite localhost:2003
# vdbench.default.[HOSTNAME].[METRIC]  There are no required options, but additional parameters can be passed to
# change the destination host and/or port as well as a custom tag instead of using the hostname.  To implement multiple
# custom tags simply separate the tags with periods.
#
# It is also possible to feed the stats from an existing vdbench workload provided stdout was written to a file.
# Simply cat the vdbench output file and redirect to vdbench_graphite.sh the same as above.  Note: original timestamps
# are used for the metrics so it will be necessary to look at the graph historically.
#
# ./vdbench -f foo.vdb -o outdir.foo | vdbench_graphite.sh -h [graphite_host] -p [graphite_port] -t [graphite_tag] -n [vdbench_hostname] -o console.foo
